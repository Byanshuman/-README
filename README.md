**Psychology | Artificial Intelligence | Cognitive & Ethical Research**

I am a psychology graduate and research-oriented writer working at the intersection of **human cognition, emotional intelligence, and artificial intelligence**.  
My academic interests focus on how intelligence — biological or artificial — is shaped by perception, emotion, ethics, and dependency.

## Academic Orientation
My work emphasizes:
- Conceptual clarity over technical spectacle  
- Ethical restraint in intelligent system design  
- Psychological realism in AI behavior modeling  
- Interdisciplinary synthesis between psychology, philosophy, and AI  

I approach AI not merely as a technological artifact, but as a **cognitive mirror** reflecting human values, biases, and limitations.

## Writing & Research Approach
- Structured and argument-driven  
- Philosophically informed, empirically grounded  
- Emotionally intelligent yet academically acceptable  
- Focused on long-term societal and psychological impact

## Guiding Perspective
> Intelligence amplifies intent.  
> Ethics determines direction.  

Understanding this relationship is central to my research and writing.
